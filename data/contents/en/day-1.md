Thanks for tuning in! This is my very first blog post on the website. I will try my best to explain all the moving parts that make it up. And also, I want to take a moment to share the story behind the creation of this website, its purpose, and my motivation for building it.


## Next.js

Having built websites with [React.js](https://react.dev/) before, I was already familiar with the basics of the library. However, there is just something missing from React.js that makes it "not quite there yet" for me. One of the things that I don't like about React.js is that it doesn't have a built-in routing system. I know that there are libraries out there that can help with this, but I just don't like the idea of having to rely on third-party libraries for something as fundamental as routing. And so, I decided to experiment with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), which is a framework built on top of React.js. Next.js is a very powerful framework that comes with a lot of features out of the box, including a built-in routing system, Server-Side Rendering (SSR), Static Site Generation (SSG), and many more. It has saved me a ton of time and effort and well, I'm just in love with this framework and I'm definitely going to use it for my future projects.

## Tailwind CSS

I remember the time when I first used vanilla CSS in my projects and let me tell you, it was such a horrible experience. Having to think of the class names, spending hours just to "center a div", oh and responsiveness! To be honest, I spent the majority of my time trying to tackle these mundane tasks rather than focusing on the actual logic and content of the website.

The moment I decided to use [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), I knew that I would never go back to vanilla CSS ever again. Just like its name, it makes your coding experience fast like a wind. Although it does take some time to get the hang of it at first and a long class name in exchange, but it's definitely worth it.
